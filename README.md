# Firebot-Beta-Program
The Firebot Beta Program

Step 1 - Go to https://discordapp.com/developers/ and log in with your discord account.
Step 2 - Create a new bot and then create a user token for that bot
Step 3 - Go to https://discordapi.com/permissions.html and enter your Client ID, and select Administrator from the permissions list (first one), then click the link to invite the new bot you just created to your server.
Step 4 - Now grab your User Token from the discord developers page and put it into your config.json file in the bot folder. (notepad or notepad++ to open the json file works fine)
Step 5 - Launch core-win.exe and test.

Notes:
1. This version of the bot is in Beta, and will most likely not work as intended sometimes, please report bugs to
