# Firebot-Beta-Program
The Firebot Beta Program


Step 1 - Go to https://discordapp.com/developers/ and log in with your discord account.

Step 2 - Create a new bot and then create a user token for that bot.

Step 3 - Go to https://discordapi.com/permissions.html and enter your Client ID, and select Administrator from the permissions list (first one), then click the link to invite the new bot you just created to your server.

Step 4 - Now grab your User Token from the discord developers page and put it into your config.json file in the bot folder. (notepad or notepad++ to open the json file works fine)

Step 5 - Launch and test. (Windows: core-win.exe | Linux: core-linux | Mac OS: core-macos)


Notes:
1. This version of the bot is in Beta, and will most likely not work as intended sometimes, please report bugs to https://github.com/Ev1dentFir3/Firebot-Beta-Program/issues so I can work through them 1 by 1 and get your feedback on them. (Please don't post duplicate bugs!)

2. Discord.js has some bugs with moving channels, so work with me on this while I find a better more reliable way.

3. I'll be releasing them in versions, and will keep the most stable versions available for some time.
